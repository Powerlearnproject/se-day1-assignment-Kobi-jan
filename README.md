#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. It is important in the technology industry because it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life like communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The advent of structured programming - structured programming introduced a disciplined approach to writing code, emphasizing clear control structures and modular design, which made software easier to understand, debug, and maintain.
Rise of agile methodologies - Agile methodologies shifted software development towards iterative processes, emphasizing collaboration, flexibility, and customer feedback to deliver high-quality software more rapidly and responsively.
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline - Driven by the need for systematic approaches to software development, software enginerring was established as a discipline, laying the groundwork for standardized practices and methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design - Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation - Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing - Conducing various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment - Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance - Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is more flexible and adaptive, while Waterfall is rigid and follows a fixed sequence of stages.
Agile manages risk by delivering small, functional increments of software, whereas Waterfall carries more risk since testing and feedback occur later in the process.
Agile involves customers continuously, whereas Waterfall typically involves them primarily at the beginning (requirements phase) and end (acceptance testing).
Example scenario for waterfall- Developing a system for a government agency where the requirements are well-defined upfront, and compliance is strict
Example scenario for Agile- Building an e-commerce platform where features may evolve based on user feedback and market trends, requiring frequent updates and iterations.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assuarance Engineer - Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager - Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs - They provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Example: Visual Studio, Eclipse
VCS - They track changes to source code and coordinates work among team members. Examples: Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges faced - Chaning requirements, Tight deadlines, Technical debt
Strategies - Effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - Testing individual components or modules of software
Integration testing - Testing interactions between different components or subsytems
System testing - Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing - Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Their importance - Helps identify and fix defects early in the development process leading to higher quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It is important as it helps to make your questions clear and specific so that AI understands exactly what is needed.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - Build a software application
Improved prompt - Develop a task management app for teams that supports user authentication, task assignments, deadlines, and real-time notifications. The app should be compatible with both iOS and Android, and integrate with Google Calendar.
Explanation - The improved prompt is more effective because it clearly defines the application's purpose, required features, and platform compatibility. This specificity ensures that developers understand the project's scope, reducing the likelihood of miscommunication and rework.
